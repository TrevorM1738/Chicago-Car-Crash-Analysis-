# Chicago-Car-Crash-Analysis-
First I removed about 30 columns off of the initial data set that would not be need such as the id number for the crashes or columns that where mostly NaNs to try and keep a larger data set. 

Then I got rid of ambiguous data such as “Unknown” and “Unable to Determine’’

Then I decided to drop the rest of the NaNs

Also grouped data into larger groups from the primary cause category so there was not too many dummy variables created.
